This is my personal website that works as both a portfolio and a private online data storage space. I built it so I can upload my files, data, and content and access 
them from anywhere in the world using the internet. The website also has a secure admin login system. When I log in with my username and password, I can access 
exclusive content that is completely hidden from public users. This private section is meant only for my personal use and contains files and data that I don’t want to share openly.
Along with that, the site is packed with features like dark and light mode, auto-playing background music, and a modern, interactive UI to make the experience smooth and enjoyable.
The public side of the website acts as my portfolio, while the admin side works like my own personal cloud.
This project is mainly built for learning, personal use, and experimentation, and I’ll keep improving it by adding more features and better security over time.
